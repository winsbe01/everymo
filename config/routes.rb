  # Example resource route with options:

  resources :users do
    resources :goals do
		resources :days

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do

  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do

  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
